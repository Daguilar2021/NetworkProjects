ICMP Ping explanation:

    dest = gethostbyname(host)

The gethostbyname() function resolves a domain name to an IP address, which is required to send an ICMP Echo Request (ping).

These are valid domain names:
    "www.stmarytx.edu"
    "8.8.8.8"
    "baidu.com"


These will not work (extra slashes or HTTP-style URLs):
    "http://www.stmarytx.edu"  # Invalid for gethostbyname
    "www.example.com/page"     # Not a resolvable domain name
